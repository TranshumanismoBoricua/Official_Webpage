	<p>My name is Israel M. Cruz Vega. I am one of the Admins of the webpage "Transhumanimo Boricua. I was born on May 11, 1994 in Manati, 
	Puerto, Rico. I am a soon to be Network Administrator, giving my all to learning to the best of my abilities. My main interests at the moment
	are learning about computer networks and the advancements of virtuality. Hopefully in the near future we will be able to transcend the body with the help of technology. No other
	invention has ever bought the world closer to each and every person. </p>

            <li>"The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.

            <p>- Friedrich Nietzsche
</p>
</li>
            <li>"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff."
            <p>-Dr.Carl Sagan-</p></li>
            <li>"Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today."
            <p>-Dr. Lawrence Krauss-</p></li>
