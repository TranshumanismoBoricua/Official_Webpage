		<p>A brief definitions of what Transhumanism:</p>
		<p>"Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the
		human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual,
		physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging 
		technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies.
		The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different 
		beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings" (source: Wikipedia).</p>
		<p>Transhumanism falls under the umbrella concept "posthumanism", which is the philosophical analysis of forms of being after humanism. 
		In this sense, transhumanism is a "transitional human", a human that wants to transcend.</p>
		<p>Purpose of the website:</p>
		<p>In this website, you will find information related to all the concepts needed to be known by all transhumans, but aimed for a local
		readership: the Puerto Ricans.
		We try daily to be updated with all the recent developments in nanotech, biotech, artificial intelligence and much more!
		You can check out our library section for a wide variety of books and literature related to transhumanism, science and philosophy.</p>
