		<p>A brief definitions of what Transhumanism: (source: Wikipedia)</p>
		<p>Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the
		human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual,
		physical, and psychological capacities. Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging 
		technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies.
		The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different 
		beings with abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of posthuman beings.</p>
